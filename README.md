This repo is all of the code for homework assignments for my Data Structures class. I'm particularly proud of my work in `index_tree` as well as `hunt`. 

From a legal standpoint, I consider this work to be under Creative Commons license, like my entire public GitHub, but I've only gone through the formalities for more unique/original code. 

If you're a student, use good judgement, please don't copy-paste, and remember that this is googleable. I'm big on academic honesty, and in a copy-paste world like coding, that requires some discretion. I leave your education in your hands.
